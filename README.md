# Overview

This was a small passion project meant to for me to delve into emulator programming to learn the basics.

## Instructions

1. Download the code from this repository
2. In your command prompt/terminal, go to the folder which you downloaded the code
3. Type the command ./chip8 *ENTER FILENAME* (e.x. ./chip8 Pong.ch8)
4. Enjoy!

*Note:* this was compiled on a windows machine, so depending on your system, the file format may not be compatible.
In this case, make sure to have gcc installed, and compile with the c file with the following command:
``gcc -o chip8 chip8.c ``
After that, an executable compatible with your system should be available, and running step 3 again should work
